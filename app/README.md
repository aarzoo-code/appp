# AI Lab — Vite + React + TypeScript

This repository is a Vite + React + TypeScript app using TailwindCSS and a component library.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the dev server (ports configured in `vite.config.ts` — default :8080)

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Build for production

```bash
npm run build
```

4. Lint

```bash
npm run lint
```

Notes
- The dev server binds to port 8080 by default.
- Components live in `src/components`. Shared variant utilities were moved to `src/components/variants.ts`.
