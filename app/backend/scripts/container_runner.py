"""Containerized job runner helper.

This helper runs a provided command inside a Docker container (example) to better
isolate execution. It uses the `docker` CLI via subprocess. In production you should
use a proper orchestrator (Kubernetes) and stronger sandboxing.

API:
  run_in_container(command: str, timeout: int = 30, memory: str = '256m') -> (exit_code, output)

Note: This script does not execute containers in CI here â€” it's a scaffold to be used
when the environment has Docker available.
